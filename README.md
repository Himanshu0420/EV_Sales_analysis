# EV_Sales_analysis
# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis by State in India

This project was completed during my internship at **Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.**, where I explored electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across Indian states using real-world sales data.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze regional EV sales trends
- Visualize sales by year, state, vehicle category and type
- Predict EV sales using machine learning
- Identify key features affecting EV sales

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning: RandomForestRegressor
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset was provided by **Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.**  
- Format: CSV  
- Contains over 96,000 rows of EV sales records from 2014 to 2023  
- Features include:
  - Year, Date, State
  - Vehicle Class, Category, Type
  - Sales Quantity

---

## 🔍 Key Visualizations

- Year-wise and Month-wise EV sales trends
- State-wise EV adoption
- Vehicle class/category/type analysis
- Actual vs. Predicted EV sales

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **Target**: `EV_Sales_Quantity`  
- **Features**: One-hot encoded State, Vehicle details, Month, etc.  
- **Evaluation**: RMSE, feature importance

---

## 📈 Insights

- Highest sales observed in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh
- 2-wheelers dominate EV sales followed by 3-wheelers
- Commercial vehicle categories show rapid adoption in northern states
